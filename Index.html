        <h2>Brief Work History:</h2>
            <p>
                Hello, my name is John Chiodo, I started my career in telecommunications with 
                AT&amp;T in 1987, the company went thru many changes and so my skill set. I 
                originally come from a hardware backround and a few of my early positions
                at AT&amp;T were hardware design related. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Thoughout the years I shifted my skills to programming in assembly and C. I
                found an opening n the wireless division and soon realized there was a void in 
                the testing area. I pplied my skills to unit level and cluster/network level testing.
            </p>
            <p>    
                I have worked with many different cell types, servers and cellular protocols
                mobile phones and networks.
            </p>
